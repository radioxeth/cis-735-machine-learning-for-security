### Basic Statistics Terminology
- random experiment: experiment where outcome cannot be predicted
- sample space: collection of all outcomes of the experiment ($SS$)
- Event: an outcome from experiment ($E$)
- Sample: a collection of events from repeated trials/experiments ($S$)
- Probability: $p=P(E)$ a number assigned to event representing the fraction of experiment resulting with event $A\Rightarrow{}p(x)=P(x=X)$
- Probability Density Function: $f(x)=p(x=X)$ on $SS$
- Probability distribution function $F(x)=p(x\le{}X)$ on $SS$
